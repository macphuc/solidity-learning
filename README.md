# Solidity Learning Repository

This repository is structured for learning and experimenting with Solidity smart contracts.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/` — Solidity contracts go here
- `scripts/` — Deployment or interaction scripts
- `test/` — Tests for your contracts (using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Solidity)

Feel free to add, modify, or remove files as you learn.
